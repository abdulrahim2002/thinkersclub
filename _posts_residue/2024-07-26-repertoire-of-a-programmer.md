## Introduction

1. git
2. linux: linux is the panacea of your all environment related ills.
3. vim/emacs



## adding images

host your images somewhere, and put it here as:

![image](url)

host in cludinary or unsplash are good, because they let you control requested images in query parameters. 

when hosting on cloudinary, upload the image. then after the upload add,

```
/c_scale,w_780 

for a width of 780.
