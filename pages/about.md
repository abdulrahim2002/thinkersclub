# Future Roadmap
We are considering to enable, user generated content, on the website.

so a user would be able to create posts from within the website,
currently to create a post the user would have to fork the repo add post
to their fork and then submit a merge request if it gets accepted their
article make their way to the website , while this method is good
because the friction in publishing would hopefully promote better
quality articles, but it also makes it difficult for newcommers to
contribute.
interdisciplinary collaboration in research and development.
