# Community Guidelines

Although Thinkers Club advocates for liberty and opposes censorship, our
objective is to cultivate a community of both thinkers and free
thinkers. To ensure that we progress effectively toward our platformâ€™s
goals, we have established specific guidelines.

Comments We encourage constructive criticism of the ideas and methods
presented by authors, as we believe that scrutiny fosters improvement.


However, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- Avoid posting off-topic comments.
- Comments deemed inappropriate by moderators will be removed.
- Moderators reserve the right to remove any comment that violates these guidelines or is otherwise deemed offensive.
