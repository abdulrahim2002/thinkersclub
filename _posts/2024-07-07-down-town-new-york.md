Strategies for This Topic
In this task, you are asked to discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the
statement. Thus, responses may range from strong agreement or strong disagreement to
qualified agreement or qualified disagreement. You are also instructed to explain your
reasoning and consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true. A
successful response need not comment on all or any one of the points listed here and may
well discuss other reasons or examples not mentioned here in support of the position
taken.
Although this topic is accessible to respondents of all levels of ability, for any response to
receive a top score, it is particularly important that you remain focused on the task and
provide clearly relevant examples and/or reasons to support the point of view you are
expressing. Lower level responses may be long and full of examples of modern technology,
but those examples may not be clearly related to a particular position. For example, a
respondent who strongly disagrees with the statement may choose to use computer
technology as proof that thinking ability is not deteriorating. However, the mere existence
of computer technology does not adequately prove this point; e.g., perhaps the ease of
computer use inhibits our thinking ability. To receive a higher-level score, the respondent
should explain in what ways computer technology may call for or require thinking ability.
This topic could elicit a wide variety of approaches, especially considering the different
possible interpretations of the phrase "the ability of humans to think for themselves."
Although most respondents may take it to mean problem solving, others could interpret it
as emotional and social intelligence; i.e., the ability to communicate/connect with others.
With any approach, it is possible to discuss examples such as calculators, word processing
tools such as spell/grammar check, tax preparation software, Internet research and a
variety of other common household and business technologies.You may agree with the topic and argue that:
reliance on technology leads to dependency; we come to rely on problem-solving
technologies to such a degree that when they fail we are in worse shape than if we
didn't have them
everyday technologies such as calculators and cash registers have decreased our
ability to perform simple calculations, a "use it or lose it" approach to thinking ability
Or you may take issue with the topic and argue that technology facilitates and
improves our thinking skills, arguing that:
developing, implementing and using technology requires problem solving
technology frees us from mundane problem solving (e.g., calculations) and allows us
to engage in more complex thinking
technology provides access to information otherwise unavailable
technology connects people at a distance and allows them to share ideas
technology is dependent on the human ability to think and make choices (every
implementation of and advance in technology is driven by human intelligence and
decision making)
On the other hand, you could decide to explore the middle ground in the debate and point
out that while technology may diminish some mental skill sets, it enables other (perhaps
more important) types of thinking to thrive. Such a response might distinguish between
complex problem solving and simple "data maintenance" (i.e., performing calculations and
organizing information).
Other approaches could involve taking a historical, philosophical or sociological stance or,
with equal effectiveness, using personal experience to illustrate a position. One could
argue that the value or detriment of relying on technology is determined by the individual
(or society) using it or that only those who develop technology (i.e., technical specialists) are
maintaining their problem-solving skills, while the rest of us are losing them.
Again, it is important for you to avoid overly general examples or lists of examples without
expansion. It is also essential to do more than paraphrase the prompt. Please keep in mind
that what counts is the ability to clearly express a particular point of view in relation to the
issue and specific task instructions and to support that position with relevant reasons
and/or examples.

2Essay Response — Score 6
The statement linking technology negatively with free thinking plays on recent human
experience over the past century. Surely there has been no time in history where the lived
lives of people have changed more dramatically. A quick reflection on a typical day reveals
how technology has revolutionized the world. Most people commute to work in an
automobile that runs on an internal combustion engine. During the workday, chances are
high that the employee will interact with a computer that processes information on silicon
bridges that are .09 microns wide. Upon leaving home, family members will be reached
through wireless networks that utilize satellites orbiting the earth. Each of these common
occurrences could have been inconceivable at the turn of the 19th century.
The statement attempts to bridge these dramatic changes to a reduction in the ability for
humans to think for themselves. The assumption is that an increased reliance on
technology negates the need for people to think creatively to solve previous quandaries.
Looking back at the introduction, one could argue that without a car, computer, or mobile
phone, the hypothetical worker would need to find alternate methods of transport,
information processing and communication. Technology short circuits this thinking by
making the problems obsolete.
However, this reliance on technology does not necessarily preclude the creativity that
marks the human species. The prior examples reveal that technology allows for
convenience. The car, computer and phone all release additional time for people to live
more efficiently. This efficiency does not preclude the need for humans to think for
themselves. In fact, technology frees humanity to not only tackle new problems, but may
itself create new issues that did not exist without technology. For example, the proliferation
of automobiles has introduced a need for fuel conservation on a global scale. With
increasing energy demands from emerging markets, global warming becomes a concern
inconceivable to the horse-and-buggy generation. Likewise dependence on oil has created
nation-states that are not dependent on taxation, allowing ruling parties to oppress
minority groups such as women. Solutions to these complex problems require the
unfettered imaginations of maverick scientists and politicians.
In contrast to the statement, we can even see how technology frees the human
imagination. Consider how the digital revolution and the advent of the internet has allowed
for an unprecedented exchange of ideas. WebMD, a popular internet portal for medical
information, permits patients to self research symptoms for a more informed doctor visit.
This exercise opens pathways of thinking that were previously closed off to the medical
layman. With increased interdisciplinary interactions, inspiration can arrive from the most
surprising corners. Jeffrey Sachs, one of the architects of the UN Millenium Development
Goals, based his ideas on emergency care triage techniques. The unlikely marriage of
economics and medicine has healed tense, hyperinflation environments from South
America to Eastern Europe.
This last example provides the most hope in how technology actually provides hope to the
future of humanity. By increasing our reliance on technology, impossible goals can now be
achieved. Consider how the late 20th century witnessed the complete elimination of
3smallpox. This disease had ravaged the human race since prehistorical days, and yet with
the technology of vaccines, free thinking humans dared to imagine a world free of
smallpox. Using technology, battle plans were drawn out, and smallpox was systematically
targeted and eradicated.
Technology will always mark the human experience, from the discovery of fire to the
implementation of nanotechnology. Given the history of the human race, there will be no
limit to the number of problems, both new and old, for us to tackle. There is no need to
retreat to a Luddite attitude to new things, but rather embrace a hopeful posture to the
possibilities that technology provides for new avenues of human imagination.
Rater Commentary for Essay Response — Score 6
The author of this essay stakes out a clear and insightful position on the issue and follows
the specific instructions by presenting reasons to support that position. The essay cogently
argues that technology does not decrease our ability to think for ourselves, but merely
provides "additional time for people to live more efficiently." In fact, the problems that have
developed alongside the growth of technology (pollution, political unrest in oil-producing
nations) actually call for more creative thinking, not less.
In further examples, the essay explains how technology allows for the linking of ideas that
may never have been connected in the past (like medicine and economic models), pushing
people to think in new ways. Examples are persuasive and fully developed; reasoning is
logically sound and well supported.
Ideas in the essay are connected logically, with effective transitions used both between
paragraphs ("However" or "In contrast to the statement") and within paragraphs. Sentence
structure is varied and complex and the essay clearly demonstrates facility with the
"conventions of standard written English (i.e., grammar, usage and mechanics)," with only
minor errors occurring. Thus, this essay meets all the requirements for receiving a top
score, a 6.
Essay Response — Score 5
Surely many of us have expressed the following sentiment, or some variation on it, during
our daily commutes to work: "People are getting so stupid these days!" Surrounded as we
are by striding and strident automatons with cell phones glued to their ears, PDA's gripped
in their palms, and omniscient, omnipresent CNN gleaming in their eyeballs, it's tempting
to believe that technology has isolated and infantilized us, essentally transforming us into
dependent, conformist morons best equipped to sideswip one another in our SUV's.
Furthermore, hanging around with the younger, pre-commute generation, whom tech-
savviness seems to have rendered lethal, is even less reassuring. With "Teen People" style
trends shooting through the air from tiger-striped PDA to zebra-striped PDA, and with the
latest starlet gossip zipping from juicy Blackberry to teeny, turbo-charged cell phone,
technology seems to support young people's worst tendencies to follow the crowd. Indeed,
they have seemingly evolved into intergalactic conformity police. After all, today's tech-
aided teens are, courtesy of authentic, hands-on video games, literally trained to kill;
4courtesy of chat and instant text messaging, they have their own language; they even have
tiny cameras to efficiently photodocument your fashion blunders! Is this adolescence, or
paparazzi terrorist training camp?
With all this evidence, it's easy to believe that tech trends and the incorporation of
technological wizardry into our everyday lives have served mostly to enforce conformity,
promote dependence, heighten comsumerism and materialism, and generally create a
culture that values self-absorption and personal entitlement over cooperation and
collaboration. However, I argue that we are merely in the inchoate stages of learning to live
with technology while still loving one another. After all, even given the examples provided
earlier in this essay, it seems clear that technology hasn't impaired our thinking and
problem-solving capacities. Certainly it has incapacitated our behavior and manners;
certainly our values have taken a severe blow. However, we are inarguably more efficient in
our badness these days. We're effective worker bees of ineffectiveness!
If T\technology has so increased our senses of self-efficacy that we can become veritable
agents of the awful, virtual CEO's of selfishness, certainly it can be beneficial. Harnessed
correctly, technology can improve our ability to think and act for ourselves. The first
challenge is to figure out how to provide technology users with some direly-needed
direction.
Rater Commentary for Essay Response — Score 5
The language of this essay clearly illustrates both its strengths and weaknesses. The
flowery and sometimes uncannily keen descriptions are often used to powerful effect, but
at other times, the writing is awkward and the comparisons somewhat strained. Note, for
example, the ungainly sequence of independent clauses in the second-to-last sentence of
paragraph 2 ("After all, today's tech-aided teens ...").
There is consistent evidence of facility with syntax and complex vocabulary ("Surrounded
as we are by striding and strident automatons with cell phones glued to their ears, PDA's
gripped in their palms, and omniscient, omnipresent CNN gleaming in their eyeballs, it's
tempting to believe..."). However, such lucid prose is sometimes countered by an over-
reliance on abstractions and reasoning that is not entirely effective. For example, what
does the fact that video games "literally train [teens] to kill" have to do with the use or
deterioration of thinking abilities? On the whole, however, the response develops its ideas
about the ways that technology can promote isolation and conformity with well-chosen
examples, even if its ideas about the positive effects of technology are less successfully
realized.
Because this essay provides generally thoughtful analysis and takes a complex approach to
the issue (arguing, in effect, that technology neither enhances nor reduces our ability to
think for ourselves, but can do one or the other, depending on the user) and because the
author makes use of "appropriate vocabulary and sentence variety," a score of 5 is
appropriate.
5Essay Response — Score 4
In all actuality, I think it is more probable that our bodies will surely deteriorate long before
our minds do in any significant amount. Who can't say that technology has made us lazier,
but that's the key word, lazy, not stupid. The ever increasing amount of technology that we
incorporate into our daily lives makes people think and learn every day, possibly more than
ever before. Our abilities to think, learn, philosophize, etc. may even reach limits never
dreamed of before by average people. Using technology to solve problems will continue to
help us realize our potential as a human race.
If you think about it, using technology to solve more complicating problems gives humans a
chance to expand their thinking and learning, opening up whole new worlds for many
people. Many of these people are glad for the chance to expand their horizons by learning
more, going to new places, and trying new things. If it wasn't for the invention of new
technological devices, I wouldn't be sitting at this computer trying to philosophize about
technology. It would be extremely hard for children in much poorer countries to learn and
think for themselves with out the invention of the internet. Think what an impact the
printing press, a technologically superior mackine at the time, had on the ability of the
human race to learn and think.
Right now we are seeing a golden age of technology, using it all the time during our every
day lives. When we get up there's instant coffee and the microwave and all these great
things that help us get ready for our day. But we aren't allowing our minds to deteriorate
by using them, we are only making things easier for ourselves and saving time for other
important things in our days. Going off to school or work in our cars instead of a horse and
buggy. Think of the brain power and genius that was used to come up with that single
invention that has changed the way we move across this globe.
Using technology to solve our continually more complicated problems as a human race is
definately a good thing. Our ability to think for ourselves isn't deteriorating, it's continuing
to grow, moving on to higher though functions and more ingenious ideas. The ability to use
what technology we have is an example
Rater Commentary for Essay Response — Score 4
This essay meets all the criteria of a level-4 essay. The writer develops a clear position
("Using technology to solve problems will continue to help us realize our potential as a
human race"). The position is then developed with relevant reasons ("using technology to
solve more complicat[ed] problems gives humans a chance to expand their thinking and
learning" and "we are seeing a golden age of technology").
Point 1, "using technology," is supported with the simple but relevant notion that
technology allows us access to information and abilities to which we would not normally
have access. Similarly, point 2, the "golden age," is supported by the basic description of
our technologically saturated social condition. Though the overall development and
organization of the essay does suffer from an occasional misdirection (note paragraph 3's
abrupt progression from coffee pots to the benefits of technology to cars), the essay as a
whole flows smoothly and logically from one idea to the next.
6It is useful to compare this essay to the level-3 essay presented next. Though both essays
entail some surface-level discussion and often fail to probe deeply into the issue, this writer
does take the analysis a step further. In paragraph 2, the distinction between this essay
and the next one (the level-3 response) can most clearly be found. To support the notion
that advances in technology actually help increase thinking ability, the writer draws a clever
parallel between the promise of modern, sophisticated technology (computer) and the
actual "impact" of equally "promising" and pervasive technologies of the past (printing
press).
Like the analysis, the language in this essay clearly meets the requirements for a score of 4.
The writer displays sufficient control of language and the conventions of standard written
English. The preponderance of mistakes are of a cosmetic nature ("trying to solve more
complicating problems."). In general, these errors are minor and do not interfere with the
clarity of the ideas being presented.
Essay Response — Score 3
There is no current proof that advancing technology will deteriorate the ability of humans
to think. On the contrary, advancements in technology had advanced our vast knowledge
in many fields, opening opportunities for further understanding and achievement. For
example, the problem of dibilitating illnesses and diseases such as alzheimer's disease is
slowing being solved by the technological advancements in stem cell research. The future
ability of growing new brain cells and the possibility to reverse the onset of alzheimer's is
now becoming a reality. This shows our initiative as humans to better our health
demonstrates greater ability of humans to think.
One aspect where the ability of humans may initially be seen as an example of
deteriorating minds is the use of internet and cell phones. In the past humans had to seek
out information in many different enviroments and aspects of life. Now humans can sit in a
chair and type anything into a computer and get an answer. Our reliance on this type of
technology can be detrimental if not regulated and regularily substituted for other
information sources such as human interactions and hands on learning. I think if humans
understand that we should not have such a reliance on computer technology, that we as a
species will advance further by utilizing the opportunity of computer technology as well as
the other sources of information outside of a computer. Supplementing our knowledge
with internet access is surely a way for technology to solve problems while continually
advancing the human race.
Rater Commentary for Essay Response — Score 3
This essay never moves beyond a superficial discussion of the issue. The writer attempts to
develop two points: that advancements in technology have progressed our knowledge in
many fields and that supplementing rather than relying on technology is "surely a way for
technology to solve problems while continually advancing the human race." Each point,
then, is developed with relevant but insufficient evidence. In discussing the potential of
technology to advance knowledge in many fields (a broad subject, rife with possible
7examples), the writer uses only one limited and very brief example from a specific field
(medicine and stem-cell research).
Development of the second point is hindered by a lack of specificity and organization. The
writer creates what might be best described as an outline. The writer cites a need for
regulation/supplementation and warns of the detriment of over-reliance upon technology.
However, the explanation of both the problem and solution is vague and limited ("Our
reliance ... can be detrimental. If humans understand that we should not have such a
reliance ... we will advance further"). There is neither explanation of consequences nor
clarification of what is meant by "supplementing." This second paragraph is a series of
generalizations that are loosely connected and lack a much-needed grounding.
In the essay, there are some minor language errors and a few more serious flaws (e.g., "The
future ability of growing new brain cells" or "One aspect where the ability of humans may
initially be seen as an example of deteriorating minds"). Despite the accumulation of such
flaws, the writer's meaning is generally clear. Thus, this essay earns a score of 3.
Essay Response — Score 2
In recent centuries, humans have developed the technology very rapidly, and you may
accept some merit of it, and you may see a distortion in society occured by it. To be lazy for
human in some meaning is one of the fashion issues in thesedays. There are many
symptoms and resons of it. However, I can not agree with the statement that the
technology make humans to be reluctant to thinkng thoroughly.
Of course, you can see the phenomena of human laziness along with developed
technology in some place. However, they would happen in specific condition, not general.
What makes human to be laze of thinking is not merely technology, but the the tendency of
human that they treat them as a magic stick and a black box. Not understanding the aims
and theory of them couses the disapproval problems.
The most important thing to use the thechnology, regardless the new or old, is to
comprehend the fundamental idea of them, and to adapt suit tech to tasks in need. Even if
you recognize a method as a all-mighty and it is extremely over-spec to your needs, you
can not see the result you want. In this procedure, humans have to consider as long as
possible to acquire adequate functions. Therefore, humans can not escape from using their
brain.
In addition, the technology as it is do not vain automatically, the is created by humans.
Thus, the more developed tech and the more you want a convenient life, the more you
think and emmit your creativity to breakthrough some banal method sarcastically.
Consequently, if you are not passive to the new tech, but offensive to it, you would not lose
your ability to think deeply. Furthermore, you may improve the ability by adopting it.
8Rater Commentary for Essay Response — Score 2
The language of this essay is what most clearly links it to the score of 2. Amidst sporadic
moments of clarity, this essay is marred by serious errors in grammar, usage and
mechanics that often interfere with meaning. It is unclear what the writer means when
he/she states, "To be lazy for human in some meaning is one of the fashion issues in
thesedays," or "to adapt suit tech to tasks in need."
Despite such severe flaws, the writer has made an obvious attempt to respond to the
prompt ("I can not agree with the statement that the technology make humans to be
reluctant to thinking thoroughly") as well as an unclear attempt to support such an
assertion ("Not understanding the aims and theory of them [technology] couses the
disapproval problems" and "The most important thing to use the thechnology ... is to
comprehend the fundamental idea of them"). On the whole, the essay displays a seriously
flawed but not fundamentally deficient attempt to develop and support its claims.
(Note: In this specific case, the analysis is tied directly to the language. As the language
falters, so too does the analysis.)
Essay Response — Score 1
Humans have invented machines but they have forgot it and have started everything
technically so clearly their thinking process is deterioating.
Rater Commentary for Essay Response — Score 1
The essay is clearly on topic, as evidenced by the writer's usage of the more significant
terms from the prompt: "technically" (technologically), "humans," "thinking" (think) and
"deteriorating" (deteriorate). Such usage is the only clear evidence of understanding.
Meaning aside, the brevity of the essay (one sentence) clearly indicates the writer's inability
to develop a response that follows the specific instructions given ("Discuss the extent to
which you agree or disagree with the statement above and explain your reasoning for the
position you take").
The language, too, is clearly level 1, as the sentence fails to achieve coherence. The
coherent phrases in this one-sentence response are those tied to the prompt: "Humans
have invented machines" and "their thinking process is deteriorating." Otherwise, the point
being made is unintelligible.
